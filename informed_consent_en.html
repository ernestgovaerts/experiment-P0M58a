    <h5>Title of the research</h5>
    <p><b>Composition and spatial layout in natural and man-made images</b></p>
    <h5>Name + contact details supervisor and researcher(s):</h5>
    <p>
        <b>Ernest Govaerts - ernest.govaerts@student.kuleuven.be</b><br />
        <b>Daan Goossens - daan.goossens1@student.kuleuven.be</b>
    </p>
    <h5>Goal and methodology of the research</h5>
    <b> In this experiment, we will explore how people evaluate different types of images. These images include natural
        scenes and man-made objects. Your task is to rate each image based on various properties, such as complexity,
        composition, and how pleasant you find it. At the end of the experiment, you will be asked to complete a few
        short
        personality questionnaires.</b>
    <h5>Duration of the experiment</h5>
    <b>Approximately 30 minutes</b>
    <h5>Conditions for participation</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>You are 17 or older </li>
        <li>You have normal eyesight or wear glasses/lenses to correct your eyesight</li>
        <li>You are participating in this study on a computer screen (not using a smartphone or tablet) </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Please read the following information</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>I understand the goal of this experiment and what is expected from me during this study. </li>
        <li>I know that I will participate in the following tasks:<br>
            <b>You will view a series of images presented in two blocks. Each block contains the same images, but the
                order and evaluation criteria differ. For each image, you will provide ratings using specific scales.
                These may include questions about how complex, appealing, or interesting you find the image. The
                experiment concludes with a brief personality questionnaire.</b>
        </li>
        <li>I know that I will be compensated for my participation by receiving course credit.</li>
        <li>This experiment will not lead to any discomfort except for possibly tired eyes after looking at a computer
            screen for an extended period of time.</li>
        <li>I understand that my participation to this study is voluntary. I have the right to stop participating at any
            time. I do not have to give a reason for this and I know that it will not have any negative repercussions
            for me. The data already collected will be processed as outlined above and there will be no further data
            collection.</li>
        <li>The data will be processed in accordance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the
            Belgian legislation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.
        </li>
        <li>In the context of the GDPR the collected data will be processed under public interest as the legal basis.
            When you end your participation the data that were already collected can still legally be included in the
            research and do not need to be deleted by KU Leuven.</li>
        <li>The results of this study can be used for scientific goals and may be published. My name or other
            identifiable information will not be revealed in such publications, and my information would be treated with
            confidentiality at every stage of the research by using codes (no names or any other identifiable
            information will be used). The publication process might entail making the research data openly available,
            which will always be done in such coded format without personal information. By participating in this study
            I agree that my data will be used for purposes as described in this document. Researchers from KU Leuven are
            responsible for processing my data.</li>
